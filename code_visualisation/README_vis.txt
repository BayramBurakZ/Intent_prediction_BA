Overview

This folder contains two GIF files that visualize the behavior and predictions of an algorithm designed to track and forecast hand movements toward different targets.

Each GIF shows:
	- Curves: These represent multiple predicted trajectories generated by the algorithm at each time step.
	- Points:
		* A black point indicates the current wrist position.
		* A gray point shows the wrist position from the previous time step.
	- Green points: These represent the possible target locations that the hand can reach. In the original recordings, the hand sequentially grasps these targets.

Target Identification
	- In the top-left corner of the GIFs, the probabilities for the top 3 predicted targets are displayed.
	- Targets corresponding to these top 3 predictions are marked in blue.
	- When the probability for a target exceeds 60%, the target is marked in red and is considered successfully recognized.

Special Target: "U"
	- A special target labeled "U" is shown at the top right.
	- This represents the case where none of the predefined targets are being pursued (i.e., "unclassified target").
	- This situation is also highlighted in color at the top right of the display.

Target IDs and Color Coding
	- Targets are assigned IDs from 1 to 7, ordered from bottom to top on the screen. The color coding for targets is as follows:
	- Black: Target is not being pursued
	- Blue: Target is likely being pursued (top 3 predictions)
	- Red: Target is actively pursued (prediction probability greater than 60%)
